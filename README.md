# Getting Started with Create React App

## What I've done throughout this project
### Add components and ready to start

First I removed all the files and that I wouldn't need in this project and replace'em with the components that I'm gonna use them throughout this projct.


### Add Dark and Light btn

I start with made a nice btn for toggle btween the dark and light mode easily.
The problem here was how to access the body element while you're using React however, I solved it by check first if the state of the dark mode is false or true and then but some taiwlind classes to the 'document.body'. 


### Add header to the page

Added header and make it stylish for both dark and light mode and responsive to fit in.


### Finish styling of Hero and Layout components

I made both Hero and Layout component stylish and responsive so I give a room to implementing the logic for both of them.


### Finish Styling of CoffeeForm component

One problem that I faced was switch btween the coffee btns when you click on Other Btn to make it not active it remove it but in the same time put the active in the last btn you'd chosen so I solve it by when you click on the Other btn it will make the data from the other btns null.
